# Air Pollution Index in Pahang,Malaysia
# ABSTRACT
Air quality is one aspect that affects human health and daily life. In Pahang, Malaysia, rapid urbanization, and development have raised concerns about the health implications of air pollution. The Air Pollution Index (API), which measures air quality and alerts the public to any possible health dangers, is a useful tool. This study intends to evaluate the trends in API in Pahang, offering information on the area's air quality and creating prediction model that will use past data to predict changes in API level in future.
# INTRODUCTION
The Centre for study on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and Greenpeace Malaysia recently conducted study, and they found that air pollution is to blame for 32,000 preventable deaths in Malaysia each year. Human health is more negatively impacted by ongoing exposure to poor air quality than was previously believed. The urgent need for predictions of the future year's air quality as measured by the Air Pollution Index (API) is addressed in this study. 

This study explores the Air Pollution Index (API) in Pahang, Malaysia. As the air quality continues to get worse every year, there is an increasing demand for predicting the changes in the API. The objective is to predict the API in upcoming years. The API is an important tool for measuring air quality, guiding public health measures, and making decisions about the development of cities.

The source of the dataset is from the Department of Statistics Malaysia. The variables in this dataset are the year, 5 stations, and the air quality status (good, moderate, unhealthy, and very unhealthy). The aim of using this data is to develop a prediction of the changes in API levels for the upcoming year.
